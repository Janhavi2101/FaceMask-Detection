# Face Mask Detection

## Overview
This project is a deep learning-based face mask detection system that classifies individuals into three categories:
1. **With Mask** – Properly worn mask.
2. **Without Mask** – No mask worn.
3. **Incorrect Mask** – Mask worn incorrectly.

The model is trained on an image dataset and can perform real-time detection using a webcam feed.

## Features
- Detects face masks in real-time.
- Supports image and video input.
- Uses a CNN-based architecture for classification.
- Can be deployed on edge devices for monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Keras
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Dataset used
- https://github.com/prajnasb/observations
- Google Image Search 5,777 images "with_mask" (3725 images) and "without_mask" (3828 images).
